## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [2.9.0][] - 2018-05-31

### Added

- The administrative UI now has introductory documentation,
  which will make it easier for new staff to onboard (#1844).
- A data quality report has been added at `/data-quality-report/`,
  which makes it easier to get an idea of how healthy CALC's
  data is (#1875).
- On local development instances, a "switch user" menu has
  been added to the top-right of every page, and sample users
  have been added, which makes it easier to see how the site
  looks and functions depending on the kind of user that is
  logged in (#1859).
- A `load_api_data` management command has been added, which
  makes it easy to "mirror" production CALC data on one's
  local instance (#1734). This obviated the need for the
  `load_data` and `load_s70` commands, so they were removed (#1774).
- CALC now uses react-loadable to load different UI components
  in separate bundles, which improves page load time. A
  Webpack bundle analyzer has also been added to make it
  easier to introspect the composition of our bundles.
  Documentation can be found in the "Analyzing bundles"
  section of the developer documentation's front end guide (#1736).

### Changed

- CALC now has a revamped logo and look-and-feel! We think it's awesome.
- The new CALC look-and-feel has been documented in the styleguide.
- Clicking anywhere outside of the user menu now closes it (#1804).
- CALC no longer uses api.data.gov to access its own API in
  production. Because of this, the `API_HOST` and `WHITELISTED_IPS`
  settings have been removed (#1766).
- A number of changes have been made to CALC's CSS:
    - CALC now uses the US Web Design System; it was formerly using
      bits and pieces of it that we had copy-and-pasted from USWDS.
      For more details on how we override USWDS and define our own
      custom variables, see the front-end developer guide.
    - CALC now uses USWDS's `usa-sr-only` class for screenreader-only
      content instead of `sr-only` (#1958).
    - CALC no longer uses words like "primary" and "secondary" in its
      SASS color names, instead opting for the actual names of the
      colors, such as `color-blue-darker` and `color-green-bright` (#1947).
- A number of changes have been made to the project's use of
  Google Analytics (GA):
    - Clicks on the "download graph" button in the Data Explorer are now
      tracked by GA (#1706).
    - Both Google Analytics accounts (DAP and standard GA) now
      behave in almost exactly the same ways, which should
      reduce confusion (#1852, #1853).
    - DAP is no longer used when users are authenticated (#1843).
- The developer documentation has been updated in a
  number of ways (#1698). In particular:
    - The Docker way of developing is now the default and _only_
      documented way of doing things. In other words, we no
      longer document how to get CALC up and running without
      Docker (#1793).
    - Docker troubleshooting documentation is now significantly
      more helpful (#1904).
    - API documentation has been moved to `/api/docs/`. It is now
      interactive (that is, users can enter search criteria and
      see the response returned by the server). It is auto-generated
      by Django REST Framework, which has been upgraded to
      3.8.2 (#1797, #1811, #1870, #1893).
    - A documentation section on analytics has been added (#1857).
- More source code has been documented and refactored for
  readability/maintainability. In particular:
    - Data capture schedule code has been documented and type-annotated (#1826).
    - The `Contract` model is now documented (#1850).
    - The project's CSS is now documented (#1871).
- Issue/PR numbers in the `/updates/` page are now automatically
  linked to their corresponding pages on GitHub (#1816).
- Searching for users in the admin panel works again (#1794).
- Upgraded React to 16 (#1685).
- Upgraded Babel, Webpack, and Node (#1687).
- Upgraded gulp-sass (#1785).
- Upgraded flake8/pyflakes (#1790).
- The usage of eslint has been rolled back to be less
  aggressive (#1852, #1867, #1868).
- API requests now validate the `sort` field properly to provide
  better feedback and mitigate DoS attacks (#1869).
- CALC's Selenium tests now use headless Chrome instead of
  PhantomJS, in both Docker and CircleCI (#1767).
- The Docker setup of CALC has been modified to limit container
  memory to their cloud.gov settings, ensuring better
  dev/prod parity (#1809).
- mypy is now run on all files, rather than a whitelist (#1815).
- All non-historic references to `hourglass` have been changed to
  `calc` (#1845).
- Upgraded d3-timer (#1977).

### Removed

- The `Contract` model's `piid` field has been removed, as it
  wasn't being used (#1935).

### Changed

- Upgraded Django to 1.9.3 (#1526).
- Upgraded jQuery to 3.2.1 (#1539).
- CALC is now prepared for migration to Django 1.10 (#1544). However,
  as the development team currently has a limited amount of time to
  work on CALC, we've decided not to actually migrate to the new
  version of Django, as we may not have time to address any problems
  occurring from the upgrade in the near future.

### Added

- Added support for recording and replaying attempted price list
  submissions (#1491), and added a new **Technical Support Specialist**
  role. This will allow the development team to better serve

  always return `200` in order to effectively monitor that endpoint (#1516).

  all bundles, and switching to a React-based component for the Experience
  slider.

## [2.5.1][] - 2017-03-20

  the New Relic monitor and djorm-ext-pgfulltext (#1498).

## [2.3.0][] - 2017-02-22

### Added

- CALC's developer documentation has been modularized and is now available at
  at `/docs/` (#1301).

### Changed

- A bug in the labor category search box that could cause the user's browser
  to lock up on special-character-only search queries has been fixed (#1355).

- The labor category search box and associated URL parameter now enforce a
  a maximum length of 255 characters (#1354).

- The navigation tabs no longer "jump" while the front page is loaded (#1341).

- Table header styling throughout CALC has been improved and made more
  consistent (#1202).

- Some minor styling bugs (#1229) and inconsistencies (#1371) in the filter box
  on the front have been corrected.

## [2.2.0][] - 2017-02-07

### Added

- A test suite for testing the production instance of CALC has been created
  (#1199).

## [2.1.0][] - 2017-01-31

### Added

- A link to "Read about recent updates to CALC" now appears in the
  footer of every page.

### Changed

- Search queries ending with trailing commas and using the "contains phrase"
  criteria now work properly.

- CALC now validates minimum wages based on the value of $10.20 per
  hour, as set forth by
  [Executive Order 13658](https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/eo13658/index.htm).

- Various improvements to the copy of emails sent out by CALC have been
  made, thanks to the efforts of the 18F Writing Lab.

- Emails are also sent in HTML format (in addition to plain text) and
  include relevant links back to CALC where applicable.

- Sent emails also now have a `reply-to` header set to a valid email
  address that will be checked and responded-to by a CALC team member.

- Errors in uploaded price lists are now displayed via tooltips (#1245).

- Explicit HTTP `Cache-Control` headers are now set on responses so that
  Amazon CloudFront will behave properly when new versions of CALC are
  deployed.

- A new `manage.py send_example_emails` command has been added to make
  it easier to iterate on the emails sent by CALC.

## [2.0.0][] - 2017-01-18

### Added

- The new data capture functionality has been added, allowing COs
  to log in (via cloud.gov) and submit their approved Schedule 70
  price lists. Data administrators can then review these price lists and
  add their data into CALC.

- Additionally, data administrators can directly upload Region 10
  bulk data. The uploaded data will then replace all existing Region 10
  data in CALC.

### Changed

- In October 2015, the schedules represented in CALC were consolidated
  into the [Professional Services Schedule][pss] to give federal agency
  acquisition professionals the ability to obtain total contract solutions
  for their professional services requirements using one contract vehicle.

  Consequently, the "Schedule" filter in the data explorer has
  been renamed to the "SIN / Schedule" filter, and allows rates to be
  filtered by SIN number.

- Searching for multiple words in the data explorer's search field
  now produces expected autocompletion results.

- The data explorer is now much more keyboard-accessible and
  screenreader-friendly.

- The "proposed price" field in the data explorer automatically
  updates the histogram on a per-keypress basis; there is no longer
  any need to click the "Go" button.

- Sharing CALC links with the "Education" field filled out now works
  properly.

- The CALC banner has been redesigned to be less confusing and easier
  to read.

- Google Analytics for CALC now properly track new searches in the
  data explorer as page views. We also track clicks on links in the
  "Contract #" column of the data explorer results table.
